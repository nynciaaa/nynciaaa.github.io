      <h2>Rich Brown Website Review</h2>

        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <h3>
        The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience
        was the loading screen when I first opened up the page. Personally, I
        found the The Rich Brown name flickering and flashing through different
        letters made me overwhelmed and strained my eyes a little, as the
        loading screen could of been better without the randomised lettering of
        his name. Other than that, it is a cool transition to take the viewers
        to his website.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </div>
      <li>
        First, I opened the page and noticed the randomised letters of Rich
        Brown's name on the loading screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon entering his website, what caught my eye is a white line trailing
        the cursor.
      </li>
      <li>
        I scrolled down his page and noticed animations and visuals elements
        popping out.
      </li>
      <li>
        I hover to one of his works and it took me to another page. I read
        through his works before going back, further scrolling down.
      </li>
      <div class="grid-box">
        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </div>
      <h3> I spent most of my time scrolling through Rich Brown website and
        looking at what he shown, because he visually conveyed a lot of information
        on the website, but in a way where it wasn't too bulky for me to read, he
        layered and sectioned his website really well. There was also really
        nice animations of his work sliding in from the sides, the text moving
        and tilting as I went through the website. Overall the aesthetic beyond
        the loading screen was perfect. <h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <h3>The most common action in my two minute interaction was scrolling through his website. It caught my attention that it was very interactive and user-engaging with it's transitions, animations and visuals being shown that matches his aesthetic. As I scrolled further down, I am able to see previews of his work whenever I hover over it. </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </div>
      <h3>I believe Rich Brown intended primary goal was to introduce users of his portfolio of his projects and works, including showcasing his awards to make it appealing to his cilents and users to commission him or collaborate. Rich down did an exellent job at making his website very eye-catching due to the mordern and minimalised aesthetic by incorparating visuals and animations when users interact with it. He does this by allowing users to hover over his works or titles and gave a short preview, allowing to take users to that work if they desire.</h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </div>
      <h3>Again, Rich brown interactive experience communicate his intended goal of showcasing his portfolio by allowing users to interact with his titles and visual elements, by hovering or clicking over it, thereby taking them to a different page to fully view his works</h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </div>
      <div class="grid-box">
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </div>
      <div class="grid-box">
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </div>
      <div class="grid-box">
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="grid-box">
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="grid-box">
        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </div>
      <h3>What was very frustrating to me was  the white line trail that follows the cursor since I found it very distracting, as it is not smooth in its movements and it's unsatisfying to look at it. Not only that, some users might not be interested in reading his works due to moving around the cursor a lot. I had a friend interact with his website and they were too distracted with the trail to the point they weren't paying attention to his websites or what its trying to convey. They had to start from the top again and thoroughly read it.</h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </div>
      <h3>What was satisfying throughout the experience was scrolling through his page and looking at the way he animated information transitioning in and out. I love the overall aesthetic of his website since I prefer minimalistic and modernised designs, as it is easy to read, colouring and theme choices on visuals or animations, nicely layered, and not too bulky.
      </h3>
