        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <h3>
        The first thing I noticed when interacting with the experience was the
        loading screen upon opening the page. Personally, I found the flickering
        and flashing letters of the Rich Brown name overwhelming and slightly
        straining on my eyes. The loading screen could have been more effective
        without the randomized lettering of his name. However, aside from that,
        the transition into his website was visually appealing.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </div>
      <li>
        First, I opened the page and noticed the randomized letters of Rich
        Browns name on the loading screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon entering his website, what caught my eye is a white line trailing
        the cursor.
      </li>
      <li>
        I scrolled down the page and observed animations and visuals popping up.
      </li>
      <li>I clicked on one of his works, which took me to another page.</li>
      <li>
        I read through his work before going back and scrolling further down.
      </li>
      <div class="grid-box">
        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </div>
      <h3>
        I spent most of my time scrolling through Rich Brown's website and
        exploring his content. He visually conveyed a lot of information in a
        structured and engaging way, ensuring it wasn’t overwhelming to read.
        The site’s layering and sectioning were well designed. Additionally, the
        animations, such as his work sliding in from the sides and text moving
        or tilting as I scroll further down, thereby enhancing the experience.
        Overall, apart from the loading screen, the aesthetic was perfect.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <h3>
        The most common action I performed was scrolling through the website. It
        caught my attention because it was highly interactive and engaging. The
        transitions, animations, and visuals matched his aesthetic well. As I
        scrolled further, I could see previews of his work by hovering over
        different elements.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </div>
      <h3>
        I believe Rich Brown's primary goal was to showcase his portfolio,
        including his projects, works, and awards, to attract potential clients
        or collaborators. He did an excellent job making his website visually
        striking with a modern aesthetic. The combination of clean visuals,
        subtle animations, and smooth transitions made the interface feel
        responsive and engaging without overwhelming the user. By allowing users
        to hover over his works and see previews, he effectively encourages exploration and engagement.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </div>
      <h3>
        Rich Brown's interactive experience communicates his goal by allowing
        users to engage with his content actively. Hovering over his titles and
        visual elements reveals previews, while clicking on them takes users to
        a different page for a full view of his work. This interactive structure
        ensures that visitors remain engaged while exploring his portfolio.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </div>
      <h3>
        I believe Rich Brown's website is designed for multiple visits,
        especially for users interested in his portfolio. The engaging
        animations, structured layout, and interactive elements encourage
        visitors to return, whether to view his latest projects, revisit
        specific works, or learn more about his awards and achievements. The
        website is not a one time experience and it can be interacted during extended browsing sessions.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </div>
      <h3>
        The website encourages multiple visits through its interactive elements.
        The hover effects, animated transitions, and project previews suggest
        that users can return and still discover new details they might have
        missed earlier. The structured layout, where information is layered
        rather than presented all at once, indicates that users can engage at
        their own pace rather than consuming everything in a single visit.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </div>
      <h3>
        The experience references modern digital portfolio designs, interactive
        UI/UX trends, and motion graphics techniques commonly used in creative
        industry websites. It draws inspiration from minimalist design
        principles seen in high-end branding, tech industry websites, and
        digital art showcases. The smooth transitions and interactive elements
        are reminiscent of contemporary web design used in creative portfolios
        and agencies.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <h3>
        These references suggest that I should interact with the website in an
        exploratory manner rather than passively consuming content. The
        interactive elements encourage me to hover, scroll, and click around,
        indicating that engagement is key to fully experiencing the website. The
        experience is designed to be discovered rather than simply viewed.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <h3>
        The sleek, modern aesthetic, combined with smooth transitions and
        engaging visuals, conveys a sense of professionalism and creativity. The
        experience feels polished and immersive, making me feel inspired and
        interested in the content. The interactive elements add a sense of
        playfulness, encouraging curiosity and engagement while maintaining a
        structured and intuitive layout that prevents users from feeling
        overwhelmed.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </div>
      <h3>
        The most frustrating part of the interaction was the white line that
        trails the cursor. I found it distracting, as it didn't move smoothly
        and was unsatisfying to look at. Additionally, some users might become
        too focused on the cursor effect rather than the website's content. I
        had a friend interact with the website, and they became so distracted by
        the cursor trail that they werent paying attention to the actual
        content. They had to restart from the top to fully engage with the
        website.
      </h3>
      <div class="grid-box">
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </div>
      <h3>
        The most satisfying part of the experience was scrolling through the
        page and observing the animations as information transitioned in and
        out. I appreciated the overall aesthetic of the website, as I prefer
        minimalist and modern designs. The colour choices, theme, and animations
        were well balanced, making the website easy to read and visually
        appealing. The layout was structured well, ensuring that information
        wasnt bulky or overwhelming.
