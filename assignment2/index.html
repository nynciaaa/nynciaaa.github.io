  <!-- I have chosen "Music for Study" for my assignment 2 -->
  <!--  I am aiming for a clean and simple layout to avoid distractions, thereby making it easy to concentrate. My websie intends to
help people focus while studying by playing calming and relaxing music in the background. The colour pallete I've chosen were brown, orange,yellow and red because it
reminds me of books and autumn, evoking a calm and warm atomosphere. It is the kind of mood I want to focus on studying in a cafe or library. */
/* brown: books/bookshelves, aged paper
red and orange: warmth, energy
yellow: soft lighting, golden hour

Fonts and icons were chosen for clarity and readability (serif fonts to reinforce the book-like mood)
  -->

  <!--  The interface will include visual feedback(volume control, update progress bar ect.. ) making the site feel interactive and responsive without being distracting.-->

  <!-- I wanted to include a focus timer but i did not have technical knowledge or skills to implement it into the design. I tried to watch a few tutorials but it took too much time
   Before the idea was removed, The timer will be used so users can keep track of  how many hours they've studied and to enhance the study experience. When the focus timer is active, music will be played in the background. When time’s up, music will slowly fade out. Afterwards, users have the option to restart the timer and adjust it to their liking -->

the media player UI is intentionally minimal to avoid visual noise and improve usability.
play, pause, and skip buttons are easy to access, with clear feedback (eg. changing icons).  Not only that, the volume control adds flexibility 
The music/audio choices were inspired by "Best of lofi hip hop 2021 ✨ [beats to relax/study to]" on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n61ULEU7CO0"
